# Capstone-Research

### Capstone Research 2017

The theme of the capstone projects revolves around ethics, data, and society. As data
scientists, ethics are an important part of our everyday lives, yet we rarely discuss the ethical
implications of our actions and our inactions. Nearly everything that we do with data, from the
collection to the cleaning to the analysis to the use of the information therein obtained, can be
used to impact our lives, those around us, and even society in general. Consequently, we must
consistently act and perform our roles as data scientists in an ethical manner.
In the capstone project, you will perform research in an area focused on the intersection
between data and society. Broad research topic domains are given from which you will
identify, in collaboration with the course professors and the project sponsor(s), a specific
research problem that you will address for your capstone project. The general themes involved
in each of these topics include ethics, data, and society and the interactions between these
three. Your research on your specific problem will address all three of these themes.
Specifically, as part of this research, you will perform an ethical analysis of the problem, the
solution, the impacts of both or any combination of these and include this analysis as one
section in your final research paper. This ethical analysis will be performed regardless of the
problem being solved for the capstone project.
